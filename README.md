SSE package for integration with Go-Wallet

Was designed to be used as a SSE integration for our main DVM Go-Wallet to provide real-time server to app updates. Designed to eliminate the firebase dependency and firebase <-> postgres out of sync error.

Coded this in my sophmore year so the code quality is not upto par anymore, will revisit sometime later.
